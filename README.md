# Highway Runner
One-Player Obstacle Dodging Car Game (NIOS II Assembly)

- Created a one player car game using an Altera DE1-SoC board
- Configured a PS-2 Keyboard to control the car using hardware interrupts
- Utilized timer interrupts to display background/ car/ obstacles animations 
- Randomly generated 4 different cars to dodge coming at different speeds with a counter
